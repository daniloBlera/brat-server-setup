# Server Setup
Just a couple of scripts to configure a working [BRAT annotator][brat-url] on an
Ubuntu 20.04 server through apache.

Run `/serverconfig.sh` to download, install and configure the server
Running `/enviroconfig.sh` will setup some utilities for better file editing and
navigation (neovim, fuzzyfind and nnn, as well as some aliases and environment
variables).
